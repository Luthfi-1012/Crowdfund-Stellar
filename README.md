🌐 Project Overview

Crowdfund-Stellar is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that enables creators and supporters to connect directly — no intermediaries, no borders.
Built using Stellar’s Soroban Smart Contracts, it ensures secure, transparent, and goal-based funding.

Each campaign runs autonomously on the blockchain, allowing supporters to track milestones, send XLM donations, and monitor project progress in real-time.

💡 Core Features:

🪙 Campaign Creation — Set funding goals and deadlines

💰 Secure Donations — Accept XLM directly from supporters

📊 Milestone Tracking — Monitor progress (50%, 75%, 100%)

⏱ Countdown Timer — Tracks deadline automatically

💼 Wallet Integration — Connect via Freighter, Albedo, or Stellar Wallets

💻 Modern UI — Built with React + Tailwind + TypeScript

🌗 Dark Mode — Smooth UI with Framer Motion animations

🌍 Vision

“To empower communities by making crowdfunding transparent, decentralized, and global.”

Crowdfund-Stellar envisions a borderless funding ecosystem where creators and supporters connect directly — with blockchain-backed trust and on-chain accountability.
No hidden fees. No middlemen. Just pure, transparent support.
