## Project Details:
Crowdfund Stellar is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Stellar blockchain.  
It enables users to create and support fundraising campaigns transparently using smart contracts.  
Funds are managed securely on-chain, ensuring donors and project owners interact with full trust.  
The project combines Rust-based smart contracts with a modern React + TypeScript frontend for an intuitive and responsive experience.


## Vision:
Crowdfund Stellar envisions a transparent, borderless fundraising ecosystem where trust is built into the code.  
By leveraging Stellarâ€™s fast and low-cost transactions, this project aims to help individuals and organizations raise funds efficiently without intermediaries.  
Our mission is to redefine digital giving â€” making every contribution traceable, meaningful, and impactful across the world.


Description:  
Crowdfund Stellar is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that allows users to create, fund, and manage campaigns securely on the Stellar network. Each campaign is powered by smart contracts that automate funding milestones, refunds, and success tracking without any third-party control. Donors can view campaign progress in real time, ensuring transparency. The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, while the backend uses Rust smart contracts for transaction logic. With low fees and fast transactions, Crowdfund Stellar empowers creators and donors globally to support meaningful projects with trust and simplicity.


About stellar:  
The vision of Crowdfund Stellar is to build a world where fundraising is fair, fast, and transparent. We believe everyone should have equal access to financial support without relying on centralized platforms. By using Stellarâ€™s blockchain, this project bridges trust between donors and creators through visible, verifiable smart contracts. Crowdfund Stellar can empower small innovators, social causes, and dreamers around the world to raise funds efficiently and confidently â€” creating a new generation of decentralized impact.


Project Plan:  
1. Smart Contract Design: Define structures for `Campaign`, `Donation`, and funding milestones on Stellar using Rust.  
2. Core Functions: Implement functions to initialize campaigns, donate, check milestones, and withdraw funds after success.  
3. Validation & Security: Add constraints for campaign deadlines, donation limits, and refund triggers.  
4. Frontend Integration: Build a React + TypeScript UI for creating campaigns, donating, and tracking progress.  
5. Testing: Write unit tests for contracts and integration tests between UI and blockchain functions.  
6. Deployment: Deploy smart contracts to Stellar testnet and host frontend via Vercel or Netlify.



Story Summary:  
As a developer fascinated by blockchainâ€™s potential, I built Crowdfund Stellar to solve a real-world problem: trust in fundraising. I saw how traditional platforms often hide fees and mismanage funds. Using Stellar and smart contracts, I wanted to create something open and fair. This project is more than code â€” itâ€™s my contribution to transparent giving and global collaboration.
